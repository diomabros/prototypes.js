# prototypes.js
(Very stupid) extensions to Javascript base prototypes

## Usage
Download proto.min.js (in ready folder) file and include it in your HTML page like:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/proto.min.js"></script>
```

If you need to debug merged files, you can use proto.js.

## Regrets
Really, really, really excuse me for my english! :relieved:
